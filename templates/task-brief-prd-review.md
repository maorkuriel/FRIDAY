# Task Brief: PRD Review

## Objective
Review **[PRD_NAME]** for technical feasibility, strategic alignment, and user value.

## Subagents Assigned

| Agent | Focus | Priority |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Engineer** | Technical feasibility, dependencies, risks | Primary |
| **Executive** | Strategic alignment, stakeholder clarity | Secondary |
| **User Researcher** | User value validation, adoption risks | Secondary |

## Files to Review
- **Primary:** [PRD_PATH_OR_DRIVE_ID]
- **Supporting:** [ARCHITECTURE_DOC], [DEPENDENCIES_DOC]

## Context Summary
[2-3 sentences of background: What is this PRD about? What phase? What's the decision at hand?]

## Thinking Level
Use extended thinking ("think hard") for this review. Escalate to "ultrathink" if complex architectural trade-offs are involved.

## Specific Questions to Answer
1. Is this technically feasible within the stated timeline?
2. Are all dependencies identified and owners assigned?
3. Does the user value proposition hold up under scrutiny?
4. What are the top 3 risks?

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All claims have document section references
- [ ] Concerns are risk-rated (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable
- [ ] Dependencies have owners and status
